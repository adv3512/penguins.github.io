<h1> Penguins </h1>
<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"> Birds that can't fly?</h2>
<p> Penguins lack the ability to fly because their wings are used to cut through water. As penguins evolved they developed shorter and denser wing structures to suit their environment. This leads their wings to serve more as powerful flippers allowing them to gracefully swim through water. </p>

<h3> Swimming in style. </h3>
<p> Penguins often bear a "tuxedo" (black and white) color to allow for better camouflage in water. Their black tops allow them to blend into the dark depths of water, while their white bellies match the warmer color of the surface of water. </p>
